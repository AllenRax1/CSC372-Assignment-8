This App is able to display a fully working Rock Paper Scissors game. The way it works is by using React with react states,
Such as useState, useEffect, useRef (those three in computerThrow), and jsx files for combining JS and HTML into one file.
I ended up using some of my previous code from my previous rock paper, scissors project, while implementing correct React components.
All the react jsx files were linked to a parent App.jsx  as a child jsx file. Then, the App.jsx was imported into the main.jsx.
